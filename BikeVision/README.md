Below is an example `README.md` you can include in your project. It covers the main points about setup, usage, testing, and additional considerations for your visionOS bike app using SwiftUI and CoreBluetooth.

# BikeVisionApp

A sample visionOS app built with SwiftUI and CoreBluetooth. This project demonstrates how to connect to a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) bike device, display real-time sensor data (e.g., speed, cadence), and create an immersive experience for cycling enthusiasts in a spatial environment.

## Overview

**BikeVisionApp** is an example application demonstrating:
1. **BLE Connectivity**: Scanning for, connecting to, and reading data from a BLE bike device.  
2. **SwiftUI & visionOS**: Using SwiftUI’s declarative UI and new visionOS capabilities to build immersive, real-time experiences.  
3. **Preview Mocks**: Leveraging a mock BLE manager for easy SwiftUI previews without needing actual hardware during development.

---

## Features

- **BLE Manager** for discovering and connecting to a bike’s service.  
- **Real-Time Sensor Data** display (e.g., speed, cadence, or custom sensor values).  
- **SwiftUI Views** that dynamically update as sensor data changes.  
- **VisionOS Compatibility** with a spatial scene (optional) for immersive heads-up metrics.

---

## Requirements

- **Xcode 15** or later (for visionOS support).  
- **Apple Developer Account** (to run on a physical device).  
- **macOS 14 (Sonoma)** or later (required for the latest Xcode).  
- A **BLE-capable bike** or device that advertises the relevant GATT service/characteristics.

---

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone or Download** this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BikeVisionApp.git
   ```
2. **Open the Project** in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd BikeVisionApp
   open BikeVisionApp.xcodeproj
   ```
3. **Update BLE Service UUID**:
   - In `BLEManager.swift`, locate the line where we scan for peripherals:
     ```swift
     centralManager.scanForPeripherals(withServices: [CBUUID(string: "YOUR_SERVICE_UUID")], options: nil)
     ```
   - Replace `"YOUR_SERVICE_UUID"` with the actual UUID from your bike/device documentation.

4. **Build & Run**:
   - Select the **BikeVisionApp** scheme.
   - Choose **visionOS Simulator** or a connected visionOS device (if available).
   - Press **Cmd+R** to build and run.

---

## Usage

When launched, the app attempts to:

1. **Scan** for a BLE device that matches your specified service UUID.  
2. **Connect** to the first matching device.  
3. **Discover Services & Characteristics** and read or subscribe to sensor data.  
4. **Display** the device name and any sensor data in the UI.

If the bike is not powered on or advertising, the app will remain in the “Scanning” state.

---

## Testing in Simulator

- **UI & Navigation**: You can verify layouts, interactions, and transitions in the simulator.  
- **Mock Data**: For sensor data, the simulator can’t connect to real BLE devices, so we rely on a `MockBLEManager` for SwiftUI previews.  
- **VisionOS Spatial Experience**: You can see a rough approximation of how your app’s windows and content might appear in the visionOS environment.

> **Note**: Actual BLE functionality **will not** work in the simulator. Use a mock approach or test on a real device.

---

## Testing on a Real Device

1. **Provisioning**: Ensure you have a valid Apple Developer profile to sign and deploy the app to a visionOS device.  
2. **Build & Run** on your physical device in Xcode.  
3. **Grant Bluetooth Permissions** if prompted.  
4. **Verify BLE Connection**: Turn on your bike’s BLE sensor, ensure it’s advertising, and watch the app connect to it.  
5. **Sensor Data**: Confirm you see real-time data (e.g., speed, cadence).
